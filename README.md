# Adapt

### Makefile
The Adapt package comes with its own `Makefile` and the `FlightTest` example. To build Adapt, simply run
```
make
```
To run the `FlightTest` example, run
```
make run
```

### Plotting

In our examples, we use gnuplot to generate raw plots in the subdirectory `Plots`. We assume gnupath is installed in `/usr/bin/gnuplot`. One can also use the dataset in the same directory to create better plots by other softwares.
